As noted on some of the license headers, there are code that have been taken and modified or taken without modification but I may have forgotten to write their names;

Rusty Russell - asprintf, list and container_of implementations (and net_* functions in socket).
Per Ola Kristensson - hashmap implementation (extended by me "Allan")
Paolo Bonzini - poll(2) code (see src/poll.c and csnippets/poll.h)
Allan Ference - remaining code (event, task, socket, ...)
